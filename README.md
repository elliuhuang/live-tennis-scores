# Live-tennis-scores

## Motivation
From the coasts of Australia to the peaks of Sweden, hundreds of professional tennis matches happen every day around the world. Unfortunately, there's no unified platform for checking all these tennis scores other than betting websites. However, they are tailored toward other sports, such as football (soccer), cricket, and basketball. Betting sites fail to integrate other features avid tennis fans might want to see, such as H2H, random trivia, and the ability to follow certain players. 
\
\
This website aims to solve that problem by providing a unified platform for browsing live scores for current ATP, WTA, Challenger, and ITF tournaments, scheduled matches, and past scores and draws of current tournaments. It will be easier to follow our favorite Alcaraz's next showdowns, Tsitsipas's shank-fest, Medvedev's verbal tirades, and Djokovic's sleepwalk to the final.
