# live-tennis-scores

Despite the ubiquity of professional tennis matches around the world, it's a shame that there is no unified platform for checking live tennis scores. Googling live scores of current ATP Tour level tournaments is sometimes a pain as we have to type the exact name of the tournament (good luck with 's-Hertogenbosch Open). And forget remembering all the ATP Challenger level tournaments where they may be as many as 7 different Challenger tournaments happening in the same week. Even when we successfully Google scores for tennis tournaments, scheduled matches are always shown in local time. Arithmetic is  hard, and no one wants to memorize all the time zone conversions. 
This app aims to solve that problem by providing a unified platform for browsing live scores for current ATP and Challenger tournaments, upcoming matches with a time zone converter, and past scores and draws of current tournaments. It will be easier to see our favorite Alcaraz's next blitzkreig, Tsitsipas's shank-fest, or Djodal's free tennis lessons for the next-next-new gen.
